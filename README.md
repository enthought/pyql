PyQL - QuantLib Cython wrappers
===============================

This library is a new set of wrappers using Cython on top of QuantLib.
It currently focuses on useful simple objects like Date, Calendar but
might be extended to more complex wrappers if needed.

This work started on QuantLib version 1.1 and 1.2 and is now requiring version
1.5 at least and supports QuantLib 1.8.

It offers support for Python 2 and 3.

Prerequisites
-------------

* [QuantLib](http://www.quantlib.org) (version 1.5 or higher)
* [Cython](http://www.cython.org) (version 0.24.1 or higher)

Building the library
--------------------

See the [Getting started](docs/source/getting_started.rst) document for the 
full details.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is pretty rough. A current build of the documentation is rendered at 
https://docs.enthought.com/pyql.
