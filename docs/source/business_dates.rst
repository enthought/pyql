Business dates
==============

Business dates handling capabilities is provided by the quantlib.time
subpackage. The three core components are Date, Period and Calendar. 


Date
----

A date in QuantLib can be constructed with the following syntax::

    Date(serial_number) 
    
where serial_number is the number of days such as 24214, and 0 corresponds to 31.12.1899. This
date handling is also known from Excel. The alternative is the construction via::

    Date(day, month, year)
    
Here, day, month and year are of integer. A set of month constant are available in the date module (January,  ..., December or Jan, ..., Dec)

After constructing a Date, we can do simple date arithmetics, such as adding/subtracting days and months to the current date. Furthermore, the known convenient operators such as +=,-= can be used. 

It is possible to add a Period to a date. Period can be created using time units or frequency::
    
    Period(frequency)
    Period(lenght, time_units)
    
Frequencies are define with the following constants : NoFrequency, Once,
Annual, Semiannual, EveryFourthMonth, Quartely, Bimonthly, Monthly,
EveryFourthWeek, Biweekly, Weekly, Daily and OtherFrequency.

Time units are constants defined in the date module :  Days, Weeks, Months, Years. 


Each Date object has the following properties :

 * **weekday** returns the weekday using the weekday constants defined in the
   date module (Sunday to Saturday and Sun to Sat). 
 * **day** returns the day of the month 
 * **day_of_year** returns the day of the year
 * **month** returns the month 
 * **year** returns the year 
 * **serial** returns a the serial number of this date

The QuantLib Date class has some useful static functions, which give general results, such as whether a given year is a leap year or a given date is the end of the month. The currently available functions are:

 * **today()**
 * **min_date()**: earliest possible Date in QuantLib
 * **max_date()**: latest possible Date in QuantLib
 * **is_leap(year)**: is year a leap year?
 * **end_of_month(date)**: what is the end of the month in which date is a 
   day?
 * **is_end_of_month(date)**: is date the end of the month?
 * **next_weekday(date, weekday)**: on which date is the weekday following 
   the date? (e.g. date of the next Friday)
 * **nth_weekday(n, weekday, month, year)**: what is the n-th weekday in the 
   given year and month? (e.g. date of the 3rd Wednesday in July 2010)


Calendars
---------

One of the crucial objects in the daily business is a calendar for different countries which shows the holidays, business days and weekends for the respective country. In QuantLib, a calendar can be set up easily via::

    uk_calendar = UnitedKingdom()

for the UK. Calendars implementation are available in the
quantlib.time.calendars subpackage.

Various other calendars are available, for example for Germany, United States, Switzerland, Ukraine, Turkey, Japan, India, Canada and Australia. In addition, special exchange calendars can be initialized for several countries. 
For example, the New-York Stock Exchange calendar can be initialized via::

    us_calendar = UnitedStates(NYSE);

The following functions are available:

 * **is_business_day(date)**
 * **is_holiday(date)**
 * **is_weekend(week_day)**: is the given weekday part of the weekend?
 * **is_end_of_month(date)**: indicates, whether the given date is the last 
   business day in the month.
 * **end_of_month(date)**: returns the last business day in the month.

The calendars are customizable, so you can add and remove holidays in your calendar: 

 * **addHoliday(date)**: adds a user specified holiday
 * **removeHoliday(date)**: removes a user specified holiday

Furthermore, a function is provided to return a list of holidays

 * **holidayList(calendar, from_date, to_date, include_weekends=False)**: 
   returns a holiday list, including or excluding weekends. This function
   returns a DateList object that provides an list/iterator-like interface on
   top of the C++ QuantLib date vector.

Adjusting a date can be necessary, whenever a transaction date falls on a date that is not a business day. 

The following Business Day Conventions are available in the calendar module:

 * **Following**: the transaction date will be the first following day that is a business day.
 * **ModifiedFollowing**: the transaction date will be the first following 
   day that is a business day unless it is in the next month. In this case it
   will be the first preceding day that is a business day.
 * **Preceding**: the transaction date will be the first preceding day that 
   is a business day.
 * **ModifiedPreceding**: the transaction date will be the first preceding 
   day that is a business day, unless it is in the previous month. In this 
   case it will be the first following day that is a business day.
 * **Unadjusted**

The Calendar functions which perform the business day adjustments are :
 * **adjust(date, business_day_convention)**
 * **advance(date,period, business_day_convention, end_of_month)**: the 
   end_of_month variable enforces the advanced date to be the end of the 
   month if the current date is the end of the month.

Finally, it is possible to count the business days between two dates with the following function:

 * **business_days_between(from_date, to_date, include_first, include_last)**
   calculates the business days between from and to including or excluding 
   the initial/final dates.

We will demonstrate an example by using the Frankfurt Stock Exchange calendar and the dates Date(31,Oct,2009) and Date(1,Jan,2010). From the first date, we advance 2 months in the future, which is December, 31st. Since this is a holiday and the next business day is in the next month, we can check the Modified Following conversion. The Modified Preceding conversion can be checked for January, 1st 2010::

    frankfcal   = Germany(FrankfurtStockExchange);
    first_date  = Date(31,Oct,2009)
    second_date = Date(1,Jan ,2010);

    print "Date	2	Adv:", frankfcal.adjust(second_date , Preceding)
    print "Date	2	Adv:", frankfcal.adjust(second_date , ModifiedPreceding)

    mat = Period(2,Months)

    print "Date 1 Month Adv:", \
      frankfcal.avance(
            first_date, period=mat, convention=Following, 
            end_of_month=False
       )
    print "Date 1 Month Adv:", \
      frankfcal.avance(
            first_date, period=mat, convention=ModifiedFollowing,
            end_of_month=False
      )
    print "Business Days Between:", \
      frankfcal.business_days_between(
            first_date, second_date, False, False
      )

and the output will give ::

    Date 2       Adv: 30/12/2009
    Date 2       Adv:  4/01/2010
    Date 1 Month Adv:  4/01/2010
    Date 1 Month Adv: 30/12/2009
    Business Days Between: 41


Day counters
------------

Daycount conventions are crucial in financial markets. QuantLib offers :

 * Actual360: Actual/360 day count convention 
 * Actual365Fixed: Actual/365 (Fixed) 
 * ActualActual: Actual/Actual day count
 * Business252: Business/252 day count convention
 * Thirty360: 30/360 day count convention 

The construction is easily performed via::

    myCounter = ActualActual()

The other conventions can be constructed equivalently. The available functions are :

 * dayCount(from_date, to_date)
 * yearFraction(from_date, to_date) 
   
TODO : add example

Date generation
---------------

An often needed functionality is a schedule of payments, for example for coupon payments of a bond. The task is to produce a series of dates from a start to an end date following a given frequency(e.g. annual, quarterly...). We might want the dates to follow a certain business day convention. And we might want the schedule to go backwards (e.g. start the frequency going backwards from the last date). 

For example:

 * Today is Date(3,Sep,2009). We need a monthly schedule which ends at Date(15,Dec,2009). Going forwards would produce Date(3,Sep,2009),Date(3,Oct,2009),Date(3,Nov,2009),Date(3,Dec,2009) and the final date Date(15,Dec,2009).
 * Going backwards, on a monthly basis, would produce Date(3,Sep,2009),Date(15,Sep,2009),Date(15,Oct,2009), Date(15,Nov,2009),Date(15,Dec,2009).

The different procedures are given by the DateGeneration object and will now be
summarized:

 * Backward: Backward from termination date to effective date.
 * Forward: Forward from effective date to termination date.
 * Zero: No intermediate dates between effective date and termination date.
 * ThirdWednesday: All dates but effective date and termination date are taken to be on the third Wednesday of their month (with forward calculation).
 * Twentieth: All dates but the effective date are taken to be the twentieth of their month (used for CDS schedules in emerging markets). The termination date is also modified.
 * TwentiethIMM: All dates but the effective date are taken to be the twentieth of an IMM month (used for CDS schedules). The termination date is also modified.

The schedule is initialized by the Schedule class::

    Schedule(effective_date , termination_date, tenor, calendar, convention , 
             termination_date_convention , date_gen_rule,
             end_of_month, first_date, next_to_last_date)

The arguments represent the following

 * effective_date, termination_date: start/end of the schedule
 * tenor: a Period object reprensenting the frequency of the schedule 
   (e.g. every 3 months)
 * termination_date_convention: allows to specify a special business day 
   convention for the final date.
 * rule: the generation rule, as previously discussed 
 * end_of_month: if the effective date is the end of month, enforce the schedule   dates to be end of the month too (termination date excluded).
 * first_date, next_to_last_date: are optional parameters. If we generate the 
   schedule forwards, the schedule procedure will start from first_date and 
   then increase in the given periods from there. If next_to_last_date is set 
   and we go backwards, the dates will be calculated relative to this date.

The Schedule object has various useful functions, we will discuss some of them.

 * size(): returns the number of dates
 * at(i) : returns the date at index i. 
 * previous_date(ref_date): returns the previous date in the schedule compared 
   to a reference date.
 * next_date(ref_date): returns the next date in the schedule compared to a 
   reference date.
 * dates(): returns the whole schedule in a DateList object.
