Issues in the dellocation process
---------------------------------

    In the test_vanilla_option, there was a segfault if we do let the object get
    deleted while out of scope. One of them deallocates something that is still
    pointed by one of the QuantLib observers. Using the del statement to
    cleanup the object in the correct order solves the issue. This should be
    solved. Using the del statement to cleanup the object in the correct order
    solves the issue.

    --> This has been solved by using shared_ptr as the structure to hold QL
    pointers on the Cython side. 

QuantLib Setings evaluation_date not working

--------------------------------------------

    Using boost version before 1.46 seem to cause issues while setting
    evaluation dates. The quantlib/test/test_cython_bug,pyx and the tests
    defined in the quantlib/test/test_bonds.py should fail.
